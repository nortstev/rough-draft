        <p>
            <em>The battle between PC gamers and console gamers</em> has been around since the '80s. There are plenty of points to say one is better than the other, but the argument between the two groups will not be ending any time soon.
        </p>
        
  
        <h3>The Systems In Questions</h3>
            <ul>
      <li>PS4(Sony)</li>
      <li>Xbox One(Microsoft)</li>
      <li>PC</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Things To Consider</h3>
        <h4>Budget</h4>
        <p>
            PC and console gamers alike want the best they can get for their budget. There are plenty of things that are tagged along with the systems themselves, like online passes and extra controllers/peripherals.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Upgrades</h3>
        <p>
            Although it is very possible to upgrade console hardware, PCs have far more upgradability and it is easier to do upgrades on a PC. When it comes to console gamers, they tend to have to buy the next generation console to stay up to date and get the most out of their games.

       <h3>Pros Of PC Gaming</h3>
            <ol>
      <li>Upgrades: PCs can be upgraded by the user so they don't have to keep purchasing the next generation system.</li>
      <li>Visuals: On average the graphics are better on PC.</li>
      <li>Custom Controls: You can choose the way you want to play with different peripherals; like keyboard/mouse, joysticks, controllers, and pretty much anything else you can bind to the in-game controls.</li>
        <li>Game Prices: PC games are most often cheaper than new console games and there are far more sales on PC gaming sites like Origin(EA), Blizzard(Blizzard+Activision), or Steam(Most Other Developers).</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Cons Of PC Gaming</h3>
         <ol>
      <li>Upgrades: Even though upgradability is one reason why PCs are great, upgrades can be expensive. New games = New parts= More money.</li>
       <li>Frame Rate: When playing on a PC that isn't top of the line, you are most likely running your games at lower settings to get the best frame rate possible. This means your games can be choppy and it takes away from the overall gaming experience.</li>
      </ol>
<h3>Console</h3>

        <h3>Pros To Console Gaming</h3>
            <ol>
        <li>Exclusives: Consoles have some really good exclusive titles that you can't find anywhere else. This alone could be the reason you choose console over PC.</li>
            <li>Price: Consoles are a lot cheaper than a new PC and are more budget friendly than PCs.</li>
            <li>Simplicity: With consoles you don't have to do hardware and software udpates to keep up with new games. They are a lot easier to set up and a lot easier to maintain than PCs.</li>
        </ol>
<h3>Cons To Console Gaming</h3>
           <ol>
            <li>No Productivity: Consoles are limited to gaming and other media consumption. You cannot work on different projects or do much productivity related stuff on consoles.</li>
        <li>Online Subscriptions: You have to pay to play online games and subscribe to online services to play with your friends.</li>
        </ol>
 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the end, it all boils down to personal preference. Consoles and PCs are both great choices for gaming. Although PCs have a slight edge over consoles, consoles are still a very good choice. As long as you are having fun, it doesn't matter what you play on. I hope all of you enjoy your time gaming!</p>
